It has enough craft-beeriness in it to avoid being a soulless bar chain, but not so much that they feel they can charge an arm and a leg for a pint. Most 500ml beers hover around 50rmb. The beer a-okay, the fusion-y pub grub doesn't overstep its limits, the atmosphere is unpretentious despite the pipework ceiling sculpture, and they even have a little terrace with a nice view of Jing'an Temple.

The other theme is canning (hence the name), so they can and sell a lot of items like duck liver and steamed clams. All the draft beers are craft-ish and they're all 48rmb a pint. Signature cocktails range from 58-98rmb. The whiskey selection is sizable, and decidedly leaning towards bourbon, rye, and Canadian.

It is busy almost every night of the week, in every type of weather, from cold and rainy Tuesday evenings to hot summer weekend nights. The crowds are here for simple and straightforward pizzas and pastas, which the restaurant does reliably but no more. Italians are divided on the place, with many singing its praises, but just as many griping about the quality and prices. Clearly, it's good enough for the masses, judging by the all people in seats, but at this point in their long life, quality doesn't seem to be their first priority, with the food rarely rising above the level of your standard red-sauce joint. Also, annoyingly, the staff pretends to accept only cash and local cards, but when pressed, will secretly bring out a QR code to scan, hidden in a folding bill so that other customers won't get the same idea.",

Busy on weekends, due to the location, but the housing blocks surrounding it tend to block out the afternoon sun, so it's better in the mornings or midday. The Kwik-E-Mart downstairs also dispenses chilled domestic and imported beer and snacks of dubious nutritional value. Open 9am-9pm daily; 100rmb Monday to Friday, 150rmb on weekends. 50rmb for children under 1.2 meters. They say you need a swim cap here, but the rule is clearly not enforced.

It's spacious, ideal for dance parties on weekend nights, but keeps a warm vibe with  Cuban and Latin-style interiors. The soundtrack is predominantly hip-hop, house and Top 40s, with a decidedly Latin bent to it, sometimes a bit of reggaeton. Earlier in the evening, it has more of a cocktail bar thing going on, but around 10pm, they black out the windows onto the street and it turns into a full-on club. The \"There Is No Escape\" sign at the door gives you an idea of how seriously they take their partying. They've got themed parties every night, and hold two special parties a month. Other nice touches include USB charging at the bar, soundproof doors for the late nights, and big friendly parrots painted on the walls. Good look for summer nights.",

Seems like a really good spot for an after-work drink if a) you work nearby and b) you go for the happy hour. The menu's taken a turn from the steak and fries downstairs into a sort of \"too big to be tapas, too snackable to be a sit-down meal\" territory. It's a bit pricy, but the quality's good. The drinks are 68rmb to 98rmb, and are eminently drinkable. Still one of the nicer terraces in the city.\r\n",

Like Vinism, their bottle selection is on display in a glass cellar, and it is a collection of oddities. They carry a New Zealand field blend. That's when the winemaker just ferments whatever is growing in the vineyards (normally, a winemaker will ferment each varietal separately and blend the wines at specific ratios before bottling). They have an Austrian red aged in the \"solera\" system, a method of blending multiple vintages more common with Spanish sherries. By-the-glass options are equally fun and range from 68–88rmb. The food is worth a look as well. Freddy Raoult of The Nest has put together a small menu of bar bites, like homemade charcuterie, sardines on toast or house-cured salmon with a super-thick, fried blini.\r\n",

Music is indie rock like The Smiths and Interpol played at a reasonable volume early but sometimes they get into turnt up electronic music later in the night. Still, this is a lounge, not a club, and a fine place to start a night on the Bund. Unlike a lot of Bund bars, this one is nice but still laid back, and they do not enforce a strict dress code.

The iconic terrace got a larger elevated VIP seating area and boasts Shanghai's longest rooftop bar. Music is generally house, and they regularly bring in international DJs like David Guetta, Bob Sinclar, Dennis Ferrer and Claptone to name some big ones. They also host themed parties, and they make a real spectacle out of their celebratory champagne rituals. Starts early, goes late, gets packed, stays loud. Note the door policy: don't come in sandals and shorts, fellas. Must-visit for out-of-towners dipping their toes in the higher end of Shanghai nightlife. ",

Weekdays, it's 300rmb per adult, or 400rmb if you want to use the gym too. On weekends, it's 350rmb per adul, or 450rmb including the gym. Ouch! The pools are open from 6am–11pm.

It has the KOR trademarks: black, white and gold color scheme, a lot of strip lighting, smooth, modern lines and amphitheater seating built around a towering backbar. Feels like drinking in a spaceship. The sound system, playing mostly hip-hop and strictly no EDM, has the midrange softened so that it's conversation friendly. KOR Shanghai deviates from Taipei in that it opens way earlier: 3pm, currently, doing afternoon tea and then dinner from 5.30-9pm, before the lounge menu (and lighting) kicks in around 10pm. The cuisine is bold, the cocktails are eminently drinkable, the prices are surprisingly reasonable. Maybe not super, but definitely a fancy club lounge.",

            "description": "Opened by the owners of Heyday and Chef Danyi Gao, Shake is based on New York supper clubs from the 1960s, where patrons would spend an entire evening at the venue for food, drinks, and entertainment. Shake's dinner menu features fusion dishes like honey cheese tofu, Thai beef carpaccio and smoked teriyaki beef-tongue poutine, created by Danyi Gao (previously of Mr. & Mrs. Bund and Calypso). Drinks are courtesy of Colin Tait, former bar manager of Vesper in Bangkok. They've got live funk and soul music six nights a week: laid-back, chilled vibe on Sundays and Tuesdays, a bit more bombastic Wednesdays-Saturdays. Dinner is served from 6pm-10pm on Tue-Sun, and last call for drinks is around 2am. There's sometimes a 100rmb cover to get in, especially when there's live music.",

Retro arcade games like Centipede, Donkey Kong and Frogger bump up against the help-yourself (but pay later) drink fridges, stocked with Jinro soju (50rmb) and Cass beer (25rmb). The menu is one page and playfully lo-fi. Hip-hop blares. The wine room has been replaced with two tanks for live octopus. The hook of the place is their unlimited meat for BBQ’ing for 288rmb, which means choices of three pork cuts (belly, neck and collar) and three beef cuts (brisket strips, oyster blade and rib fingers), and their cheap boooooooze — not included in the 288rmb price. (Or, if you’d rather, there are premium cuts and bottles of Hibiki Japanese whisky that go for 10,000+ rmb. It is still The Bund, after all.)",
